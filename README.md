## Install

Install and have your USB Rubber Ducky working in less than 5 minutes.

1. Download [CircuitPython for the Raspberry Pi Pico](https://circuitpython.org/board/raspberry_pi_pico/).

2. Plug the device into a USB port. It will show up as a removable media device named `RPI-RP2`.

3. Copy the downloaded `.uf2` file to the root of the Pico (`RPI-RP2`). The device will reboot and after a second or so, it will reconnect as `CIRCUITPY`.

4. Download `adafruit-circuitpython-bundle-6.x-mpy-YYYYMMDD.zip` [here](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases/latest) and extract it outside the device.

5. Navigate to `lib` in the recently extracted folder and copy `adafruit_hid` to the `lib` folder in your Raspberry Pi Pico.

6. Click [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dbisu/pico-ducky/main/duckyinpython.py), press CTRL + S and save the file as `code.py` in the root of the Raspberry Pi Pico, overwriting the previous file.

7. Find a script [here](https://github.com/hak5darren/USB-Rubber-Ducky/wiki/Payloads) or [create your own one using Ducky Script](https://github.com/hak5darren/USB-Rubber-Ducky/wiki/Duckyscript) and save it as `payload.dd` in the Pico.

8. Be careful, if your device isn't in [setup mode](#setup-mode), the device will reboot and after half a second, the script will run. 

### Setup mode

To edit the payload, enter setup mode by connecting the pin 1 (`GP0`) to pin 3 (`GND`), this will stop the pico-ducky from injecting the payload in your own machine.
The easiest way to so is by using a jumper wire between those pins as seen bellow.
